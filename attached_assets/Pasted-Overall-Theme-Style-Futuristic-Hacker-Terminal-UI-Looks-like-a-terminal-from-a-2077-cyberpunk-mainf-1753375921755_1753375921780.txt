Overall Theme
Style:
Futuristic Hacker Terminal UI
Looks like a terminal from a 2077 cyberpunk mainframe, where you’re typing logs of your journey, one commit at a time.

Dark Mode Default
Deep purples, neon greens, glitchy text, flickering cursor effects. Think [Vaporwave x Developer Terminal].

Tech Fonts
Use Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, or IBM Plex Mono for authenticity.

🧠 Section Ideas
1. Landing Page – afailedprogrammer.dev
“Welcome to the terminal of someone who wrote code that changed everything — just not his job status… yet.”

Terminal-style typing:

Flickering cursor and typing intro using a typing animation:

2. Skills – ./skills.sh
Terminal cards:

bash
Copy
Edit
$ cat skills.txt

3. Projects – ./projects.sh
Each project card looks like a README.md:

✅ Violence Detection in Crowd

Python, CNN + LSTM, OpenCV

Real-time detection using hybrid DL models

🤖 AI Agents

ChatGPT Wrappers, Langchain-inspired

🛠️ Rust Backend Services

QUIC streaming, Wasm plugins, eBPF routing

🌐 MERN Stack Projects

Auth systems, dashboards, product trackers

4. Publications & Blog – ./logs.sh
A glitchy Markdown-style page with your 2024 publication and dev logs like:

"How I Built an LSTM-CNN Hybrid for Violence Detection"

"How I Built My Own ChatGPT Wrapper in Rust + Node.js"

"Still No Job. Here's What I Deployed Instead."

5. About Me – ./about.sh
txt
Copy
Edit
$ cat about-vinay.txt

Just a failed programmer trying to beat the system.
I build real-time APIs in Rust, production-grade AI systems in Python, and web apps that scale.

Companies didn’t hire me. So I built things they couldn’t.
6. Contact / Call to Action – ./hire.sh
bash
Copy
